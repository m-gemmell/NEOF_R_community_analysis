We will utilise the same data and environment as the [main NEOF R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course). 
This chapter containers a reminder on the dataset, how to setup your directory and files, and how to activate the required `mamba/conda` environment. 

## Dataset
<center>

</center>

The data set we will use in this book is the same as that used in the [main R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course/02-Dataset_and_workflow.html#dataset).

Below are brief bullet points about the data:

- It is a 16S dataset of ASV counts with taxonomy and phylogeny produced by QIIME2
- The samples come from surface water from the Durance River in the south-east of France
- There are three sampling sites on an anthropisation gradient (low to high agriculture)
  - Upper Durance (UD)
  - Middle Durance (MD)
  - Lower Durance (LD)
- Four different media approaches were used to produce bacterial lawns that were sequenced
  - Environmental sample (ENV): No media used, frozen at -20째C.
  - TSA 10% incubated at 28째C for 2 days.
  - KBC incubated at 28째C for 2 days.
  - CVP incubated at 28째C for 3 days.
- There are three replicates for each sampling site and media combination (36 samples total)

## Mamba

</center>

This book uses the same environment as in the [main R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course/04-Setup.html#mamba)

If you do not have the environment activated you can set-up your environment by run the following code (you must include the full stop and space at the front of the command).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
. usercommunity2025
```

You will have successfully activated the environment if you now see `(r_community_2025)` at the start of your command prompt. 
This indicates you are now in the mamba environment called `r_community_2025` created by the instructor.

If you are interested in the use script you can look at its contents.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
less /usr/local/bin/usercommunity
```

__Tip:__ press `q` to quit `less`.

## Directory and files
<center>
![](figures/open_file.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px; background:null"}
</center>

We will keep the analysis in this book separate to the analysis from the [main NEOF R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course).
This is so this book can be more easily approached at a later time separate to the main content.

Open up `Jupyter-notebook` with bash, ensuring you are in your home directory.

__Note:__ `Jupyter-notebook` tutorial is here: [Tutorial](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course/05-Jupyter.html)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#Set directory to your home directory
cd ~
#Open jupyter-notebook
jupyter-notebook
```

Create a directory/folder for the analysis in your home directory called "R_community_iterative_rarefaction", then move into it.
Create subsequent Jupyter-notebooks and carry out your analysis in this directory.
