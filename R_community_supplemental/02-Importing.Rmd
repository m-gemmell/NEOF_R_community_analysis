Apart from `QIIME2` artifact files, other file types from other programs cann be imported into a `phyloseq` object.

## Bracken

A common way to carry out shotgun metagenomics taxonomic abundance profiling is with `Kraken2` and `Bracken`.
This section will show you how to import the `bracken` output.

### Bracken: setup 

### Bracken: Convert to biom


Note to writer: Looks like I need to create a bracken file with the kraken2 report style to convert into a biom file.
I don't have this in my shotgun metagenomics workshop so this is a future task whilst updateing the shotgun metagenomics workshop to nsc200s.

Use [`kraken-biom`](https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom)
