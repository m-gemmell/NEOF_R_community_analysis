[Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) is a graphing library that allows you to create interactive charts and maps.
These are in the form of html files.

This works with `python`, `R`, `ggplot2`, and other languages.
You can create plots with [`plotly's`](https://plotly.com/r/) own library in `R`.
However, we'll demonstrate how to plotlyify plots with [`ggplot2`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/).

You can even embed these in online books like the below chart.
Try hovering over points to get more information on them.

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="700px"}
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4")) 
ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```

<center>
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", }
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4")) 
ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```

## Jupyter notebook
<center>
![](figures/jupyter_notebook.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

As always we'll start off by creating a new `R` notebook and loading in the required libraries.

Create a new notebook called "plotly_tut", the location does not matter.

The libraries required are:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Libraries
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
library("IRdisplay")
library("htmlwidgets")
```

## Penguin data
<center>
![](figures/penguin_iceberg.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

We are going to use the same penguin data as the first plot in this chapter.
More info in the penguin data can be found on this [website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

First we need to load it into `R` as a __data frame__.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Read in penguin data
penguin_df <- read.csv("/pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/R_community/penguin.tsv",
                       check.names=FALSE, stringAsFactors = TRUE, sep = "\t")
#Check df
head(penguin_df)
```

## PNG with ggplot2
<center>
![](figures/png_file.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

After having your data the next step is to create your `ggplot2` object.
We'll make a box plot of Species and sex of Penguin (x-axis) versus the Flipper length (y-axis).
We'll facet the plot by species and use sex as the x axis.
We'll save this as an object, save it as a png with `ggsave()`, and display it with `IRdisplay::display_png()`.
This is what we carried out in the main book.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#ggplot2 boxplot
gg_boxplot <- ggplot(data= penguin_df, aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(.~species)
#Save as png
ggsave(filename = "penguin_boxplot.png", plot gg_boxplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 200)
#Display png
IRdisplay::display_png(file = "penguin_boxplot.png")
```

## HTML with plotly
<center>
![](figures/html.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Let's create that plot again but using `plotly`.
Additionally, we'll save the `plotly` plot to an html file with `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()`.
We can then view the plot with `plotly::embed_notebook()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#ggplot2 boxplot
gg_boxplot <- ggplot(data= penguin_df, aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(.~species)
#Create plotly object from ggplot2 object
plotly_boxplot <- plotly::ggplotly(gg_boxplot)
#Save plotly object as html
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(widget = plotly_boxplot,
                        file = "penguin_boxplot.html",
                        selfcontained=TRUE)
#Display plotly object
plotly::embed_notebook(plotly_boxplot)
```

You can also open "penguin_boxplot.html" via the jupyter navigation page to view it.

## Recap

Plotly is a nice way to make interactive plots. 
These can be embedded in `jupyter-notebooks` or html reports made with programs like [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
They are very useful to interrogate data but they will not be as useful for making static plots for visualisation.

If you have the time and inclination please try making some plotly htmls with the plots you created in the main book for this course.
