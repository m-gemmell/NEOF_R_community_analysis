# Dataset & workflow
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }

## Dataset
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '50%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/freshwater_france.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 


## Workflow
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/workflow.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)

## Scripts and working directory

Different people like to sort out their workflows and directories/folders in different ways. Some people like to use [RStudio projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects). Personally, I like to create one directory for an analysis project. In this directory I:

- Have a directory with my input.
- I save my scripts.
- I save my output, possibly to sub-directories.

This is the method that will be used in these materials. To start, create a directory on your computer for the analysis of the French freshwater data (can be done inside our outside of RStudio. For example:

__"~/R/R_community_course/freshwater_data_analysis/"__

Next we need our data. Download and save the following link into your analysis directory:

__[freshwater_water_france.zip](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Unix_nxcdf7/01-Intro_to_Unix.html)__

It is a zipped directory, therefore unzip the directory/folder.

`r hide("Windows unzipping")`
- Open File Explorer and find the zipped folder.
- To unzip the entire folder, right-click to select Extract All, and then click "Extract".
`r unhide()`

`r hide("Mac unzipping")`
- Double-click the .zip file.
`r unhide()`

Finally, set your working directory in RStudio to your analysis directory.
