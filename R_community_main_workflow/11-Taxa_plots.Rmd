# Taxa plots

Now that we have our Genus relative abundance `phyloseq` we can create a bar chart.

## Simple bar chart

To create a simple genus bar chart we can use the following code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Simple bar chart
phylum_bar <- microbiome::plot_composition(phylum_pseq)
phylum_bar
```

We have created and saved a `ggplot` object called `phylum_bar`. 
We then viewed it by calling the object.
This is a good start but the plot is a bit hard to read.

### Save ggplot as png

It can be a good idea to save a `ggplot` object as a file with `ggsave()`.
This allows you to select the size and resolution (`dpi`) of the image.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./phylum_relabund_simple.png", plot = phylum_bar,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
```

### Display png

We can use the R package [`IRdisplay`](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRdisplay) to display plots from files in `jupyter-notebook`.

Use the function `display_png()` to display our bar chart.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./phylum_relabund_simple.png")
```

### Editing the plot

Components can be added to `ggplot2` objects to edit the plot.
They are added with the `+` symbol.

Go to the cell where you created your plot and add components so it looks like the below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Simple bar chart
phylum_bar <- microbiome::plot_composition(phylum_pseq) +
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Relative abundance") +
  ggtitle("Phylum relative abundance bar chart")
```

Now save and display the plot.

## Taxa heatmap

Our bar chart looks quite nice but for displaying all taxa present it may be better to use a heatmap.
Use the below code to produce and visualise a heatmap.

__Tip__: I encourage you to copy and paste your previous bar chart code to edit.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Produce heatmap ggplot
phylum_heatmap <- microbiome::plot_composition(phylum_pseq, plot.type = "heatmap") +
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Relative abundance") +
  ggtitle("Phylum relative abundance heatmap")
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./phylum_relabund_heatmap.png", plot = phylum_bar,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./phylum_relabund_heatmap.png")
```

With the heatmap it is much easier to tell what the relative abundances of different phyla are.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Chloroflexi__", "__Firmicutes__", answer="__Proteobacteria__")
```
- What is the most abundant phyla across the samples? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

## Aggregate rare taxa

From our bar chart and our heatmap we can see that there are a few high abundance phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, & Proteobacteria) and many low abundance phyla.

To make a better visualisation we will aggregate the rare phyla.
This will give us less phyla to plot so we don't need to use so many colours.

To carry this out we will use the `microbiome` function `aggregate_rare()`.
The function has three main options:

- __`level =`__: Taxa level to aggregate table.
- __`detection =`__: Detection threshold (see below).
- __`prevalence =`__: Prevalence threshold (see below).

The function will aggregate taxa to our specified level. 
Whilst doing this it will aggregate the rare taxa of that level to one group called "Other".
Rare taxa are specified via the __detection__ and __prevalence__ thresholds.
Any taxa with an abundance >= to the __detection__ threshold in a number of samples >= to the __prevalence__ threshold will be kept.
The taxa which don't reach these thresholds will be classified as rare and aggregated into "Other".

In the below example we are aggregating the rare taxa with our ASV relative abundance `phyloseq` object.
Any phyla with a relative abundance >= to 0.01 (__detection__) in at least 5% (5/100) of the samples will not be classified as rare.

More info on [Prevalence & detection](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/quality-control.html#prevalence).

__Note__: The __detection__ and __prevalence__ thresholds can be given as numbers (1, 2, 1000 etc.), or percentage values (5/100, 50/100, etc.).

Aggregate the relative abundance table to phyla with the rare thresholds:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Aggregate rare phyla
phylum_rareaggregate_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "phylum",
  detection = 0.01, prevalence = 5/100
)
```

We will plot this as a new taxonomy bar chart with some additions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Plot
#Add otu.sort to sort phyla by abundance (highest to lowest)
phylum_bar <- microbiome::plot_composition(phylum_rareaggregate_pseq) +
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Relative abundance") +
  ggtitle("Phylum relative abundance bar chart") +
  #Change colours of Phylum to that of the "Paired" palette from colour brewer
  scale_fill_brewer("Phylum", palette = "Paired")
#Save ggplot object as png
ggsave(filename = "./phylum_relabund_rareaggregate.png", plot = phylum_bar,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./phylum_relabund_rareaggregate.png")
```

`r hide("Colour brewer palettes")`
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '80%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/colour_brewer_palettes.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
[Source](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)
`r unhide()`

That is a very nice and clean bar chart.
We can quite easily see that there are 7 main phyla.
Additionally, it seems that the biggest difference between samples is due to the media used.
