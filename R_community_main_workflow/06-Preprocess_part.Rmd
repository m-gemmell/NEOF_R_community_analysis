# (PART\*) Data preparation {-}

# Data prep intro
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/half_tablespoon.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In the next 3 chapters (7-9) we will learn how to:

- [Import our data.](#import_chap)
- [Summarise our `phyloseq` object.](#sum_phyloseq_chap)
- [Determine the minimum read depth for samples to be used.](#mindepthchap)

We will also use this as a chance to reinforce how to use `jupyter-notebook` with clear instructions. 
However, from chapters 10 onwards you will make more decisions on how many __"Coding"__ and __"Markdown"__ cells you want.
