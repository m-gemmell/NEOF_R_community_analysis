Below are some useful resource if you would like to learn ggplot2.

The [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) is a good place to start. It contains a section called [Understanding ggplot2](https://r-graphics.org/chapter-ggplot2) in its appendix which is useful for learning some key terminologies and concepts.

`ggplot2` requires its input to be in long format. You will therefore need to know how to [convert your wide data to long data](#http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_data_between_wide_and_long_format/).
