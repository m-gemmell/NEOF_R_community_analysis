# Family & Genus plots
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/owl_eyes.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In this chapter you will:

- Create Family plots by following example code.
- Be tasked to create Genus plots with little instruction.

I highly encourage you to copy previous code and edit it.
It is a major time saver.
However, it can be easy to over look some edits so it is good to double check your edited code to ensure you have changed the relevant options, and object & file names.

## Family taxa plots

This part will show you a nice workflow for creating some family based taxa plots.
Run this at the bottom of you "3-taxonomy_barchart.ipynb" notebook.

### Aggregate families

First we will create a `phyloseq` object by aggregating the families from the relative abundance `phyloseq` object.
Let us also then check the family `phyloseq` object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Family phyloseq
family_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_taxa(pseq_relabund, "Family", verbose = FALSE)
#Head of phylum relative abundance table
head(phyloseq::otu_table(family_pseq))
#Number of families
paste0("Number of families: ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(family_pseq)))
#Summarise
microbiome::summarize_phyloseq(family_pseq)
microbiome::readcount(family_pseq)
```

We have 112 families. Quite a bit but hopefully they will all fit into a heatmap.

### Family heatmap

We will create a heatmap as before with one added `ggplot2` component.
As there are a lot of Families (112) and fewer samples (36) it will be easier to view if we have the families on the y-axis.
By default `microbiome::plot_composition()` will plot the taxa/families on the x-axis.
Thankfully we can use the `ggplot2()` function/component `coord_flip()` to flip/swap the x and y axes.
Note that the `xlab()` and `ylab()` are specified the text before this flipping.
E.g. `xlab()` is set to "Family" which will appear on the y axis because of the flip

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Family heatmap
family_heatmap <- microbiome::plot_composition(family_pseq, plot.type = "heatmap") +
  xlab("Family") + ylab("Sample") +
  ggtitle("Family relative abundance heatmap") +
  #Flip the x and y axes
  coord_flip()
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./family_relabund_heatmap.png", plot = family_heatmap,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./phylum_relabund_heatmap.png")
```

The plot is quite large.
You can right click on the image and click "Open Image in New Tab" to view the whole image in a new tab firefox.

With this heatmap we can see that the KBC and TSA samples have a high relative abundance of _Pseudomonadaceae_ whilst the TSA samples have a high relative abundance of _Aeromonadaceae_.
Additionally, we can see that a lot of families have relatively low relative abundances.

Once you are finished looking at the plot you can close the tab containing the plot.
Next we'll carry out our rare aggregation and produce some bar charts.

### Family rare aggregation

To aggregate our rare families we need to choose a suitable [detection and prevalence threshold](#aggregateraretaxa).
Generally, this is a process of trial and error trying to get a total of 12 taxa.
Twelve is a good number as it is the total number of colours in the Paired palette from Colour brewer.
You may need more in your own analysis so it is not a hard limit.

Therefore, lets try out various thresholds and see how many families we get.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Aggregate rare phyla
phylum_rareaggregate_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "phylum",
  detection = 0.01, prevalence = 5/100
)
```
