# Mamba installation and environment {#mamba_install}

Mamba github: https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba

Mamba installation: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge

Mamba guide: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html

To create the mamba environment `r_community` run the below commands in your bash. You will need to have installed `mamba` first.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#R community
mamba create r_community
mamba activate r_community
mamba install -c bioconda bioconductor-microbiome
mamba install -c r r-tidyverse
mamba install -c conda-forge r-devtools
#Update r-htmltools as loading devtools doesnâ€™t work in R (from 0.5.2 -> 0.5.4)
mamba install -c conda-forge r-htmltools=0.5.4
#If using jupyter-notebook, need to install r kernel for it
mamba install -c conda-forge r-irkernel
```

Activate the environment in bash.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mamba activate r_community
```

Activate your `mamba's` `R` and install `Qiime2R`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
R
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jbisanz/qiime2R")
```

# Jupyter-notebook

If you are running this on your own computer you can use `RStudio`.
However, you can also use `Jupyter-notebook` if you are using an HPC or prefer it.

If using bash you will need to create an environment with `Jupyter-notebook`.
Ensure you are in the `(base)` mamba environment.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mamba create -n jupyter
mamba activate jupyter
mamba install -c anaconda jupyter
mamba deactivate
```

To run `Jupyter-notebook` with your `r_community` environment you can run the following.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#Activate you R_community env
mamba activate r_community
#Run jupyter-notebook (may be a slightly different path)
~/mamba/envs/jupyter/bin/jupyter-notebook
```

# ggplot2 {#ggplot2_appendix}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/ggplot2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Below are some useful resource if you would like to learn ggplot2.

The [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) is a good place to start. It contains a section called [Understanding ggplot2](https://r-graphics.org/chapter-ggplot2) in its appendix which is useful for learning some key terminologies and concepts.

`ggplot2` requires its input to be in long format. You will therefore need to know how to [convert your wide data to long data](#http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_data_between_wide_and_long_format/).
