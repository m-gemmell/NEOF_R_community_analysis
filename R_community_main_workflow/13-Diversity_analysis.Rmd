In the next X chapters we will carry out diversity analyses. This will include calculating and visualising diversity values plus carrying out the associated statistics.

In the chapters we will carry out:

- Rarefaction of our ASV table.
- Alpha diversity of the rarefied data.
- Beta diversity of the rarefied data.
- Biomarker detection.

During this we will attempt to answer our questions from [Chapter 2](#summary-questions):

- How does the bacterial communities change across the anthropisation gradient?
- Is there a difference in the replicates of one site and media combination. I.e. do any of the media produce inconsistent profiles.
- Is there more difference between the sites or the media used?
- Do any of the media produce a similar taxonomic profile to the environmental sample?
