This website acts as a resource to demonstrate how to create various figures for community analysis not covered in the other materials:

- [R coomunity analysis main workflow](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course)
- [R community analysis supplemental](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Supplemental/)
- [R community analysis iterative rarefaction](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/iterative_rarefaction)

It is recommened you go through the first section __Tidyverse__. 

ADD SECTION GIVING QUICK INTRO TO TIDYVERSE INCLUDING PIPING



The figures include:

- [Upset plot](./upset): A visualisation of the intersection of multiple sets. This can be a much more efficient and clear method compared to Venn diagrams.
